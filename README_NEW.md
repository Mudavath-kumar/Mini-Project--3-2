# MambaTab Fraud Detection (Extended Notes)

This document provides additional context beyond the main README.

For the primary project overview and setup instructions, see `README.md`.

## Overview

This project demonstrates a credit-card fraud detection workflow using:

- **MambaTab** (PyTorch) as the default inference model in the Streamlit UI
- Optional baseline models for comparison (when available)

The goal is an academic, judge-safe demo: it separates unlabeled “stream scoring” from supervised evaluation (metrics are shown only when ground-truth labels exist and both classes are present).

## Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```

## Model and architecture

Architecture notes are documented in `MAMBATAB_ARCHITECTURE.md`.

## Training (optional)

```bash
python train_baselines.py
```

Artifacts are written under `models/`.

## Notes on evaluation

- Fraud detection is typically imbalanced; accuracy can be misleading.
- When labels are present, prefer AUC-ROC and recall (plus precision/F1 depending on the operating point).
- When labels are not present, only risk summaries are meaningful.

## Disclaimer

This repository is for academic demonstration and experimentation. It is not a production fraud system.
- Features: 35 (V1-V28 PCA + Amount + Time + 5 engineered)
- Split: 60% train, 20% validation, 20% test

**Engineered Features:**
- `amount_scaled`: Log-transformed transaction amount
- `time_mod_day`: Time of day (seconds modulo 86400)
- `ip_risk_dummy`: IP address risk score (0-100)
- `device_flag_dummy`: Device fingerprint flag
- `merchant_risk_dummy`: Merchant category risk
